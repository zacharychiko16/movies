        Welcome to our movie database website! A platform that allows users to
        discover and explore a wide range of movies. It is built using the TMDB
        API, which provides an extensive database of movies, television shows,
        and other video content. This API allows your website to display a vast
        collection of movies from various genres, including action, drama,
        comedy, thriller, and many more.

        Another notable feature of our website is its search functionality,
        which allows users to find movies easily. The search bar is prominently
        displayed on the website&apos;s homepage, making it easy for users to search
        for specific movies, actors, or directors. Once a user has entered their
        query, the website displays relevant search results, allowing them to
        quickly find the movie they are looking for.

        The movie information page is another key feature of our website. When a
        user clicks on a specific movie, they are directed to a dedicated page
        that provides detailed information about the movie. This information
        includes the movie&apos;s title, release date, genre, runtime, cast,
        director, and a brief synopsis. Additionally, the page displays user
        ratings and reviews, enabling users to get a better understanding of
        what other people think about the movie. In summary, your movie website
        is an engaging and user-friendly platform that provides movie lovers
        with a convenient and exciting way to discover and explore new films.
        With its extensive collection of movies, intuitive search functionality,
        and detailed movie information pages, your website is an excellent
        resource for anyone looking to expand their movie-watching horizons.
